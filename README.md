# Classic-ML
In this repository I have compiled some of the classical ML algorithms I have implemented in Python

Those algorithms inlude:

  K-Nearest-Neighbour  
  Decision Tree Classification and Regression  
  Support Vector Machine  
  Support Vector Regression  
  Linear Regression (with Lasso and Ridge normalization)  
  Naive Bayes Classification  
  Linear Discriminant Analysis  
  Quadratic Discriminant Analysis  
  Logistic Regression  
  PCA  
  Hierarchical Clustering  
  K-Means Clustering  
  DBScan
